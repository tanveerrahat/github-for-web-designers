Github for Web Designers 
========================

Hi, this is a conventional repository I created while learning a course from lynda.com which is Github for Web Designers by James Willamson. 

All the works have been done by him and I just replicated those commits from that tutorial in this repository to learn Git and Github. Thanks to James, here's his [twitter handle](https://twitter.com/jameswillweb/)
